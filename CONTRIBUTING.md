# Contributing

All projects need help including Essentials-S. If you want to help thats great, you don't even need to know how to code to help. Here are a few ways in which you can help

## Testing

When it comes to testing, you are trying to break the plugin (within reason -> will not accept bug reports where you have opened the plugin up and deleted files), so have a go. Try every command in the most uncommon of ways. Try using Essentials-S on the latest Sponge outside the supported versions. If reported, all of these can be fixed and made better for all users.

You can report any and all your findings on the [Issues](https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/issues/new/choose) page.

## Docuemntation

When it comes new users, we will always point them in the direction of our [Wiki's](https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/wiki) however we know that they arn't perfect. They will be missing some information that someone may find really useful. The good news is we accept requests for the Wiki to be changed [here](https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2Ctriage&template=MissingDocumentation.yml&title=%5BWiki%5D%3A+) and even user created Wiki pages (Like this)[https://github.com/EssentialsS/Implementation/wiki/Community-Wiki]

## Code

This is the typical way in which people think how to contrubute and we will gladly accept it. 

To add your own code into Essentials-S you must read our Wiki article on how to contribute by code (Work in progress)
